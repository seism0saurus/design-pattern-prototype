# Design Pattern: Prototype

This is a simple example of the singleton pattern. I wrote a blog post about it:
https://seism0saurus.de/design-pattern-prototype.html (German)

The code is separated into two parts. The before package shows an implementation without the pattern. The after package
shows the implementation with a prototype.
There is also an optimized version, that encapsulates the cloning and changing of fields.
